### **3.1 Compartments**

The AI Services LZ Extension  includes the following compartments:
> [!NOTE]
> Compartments help you organize and control access to your resources. A compartment is a collection of related resources (such as cloud networks, compute instances, or block volumes) that can be accessed only by those groups that have been given permission by an administrator in your organization.

The following table provides details on the compartments presented above, their level of deepness in the tenancy, and objectives.

## **5. Runtime View**


This chapter presents the AI Services LZ Extension operations scenarios.

The operations scenarios are one of the most important elements of this design, as they represent the use cases and its key activities on the AI Services LZ Extension that create or update resources.

An operation scenario is normally triggered by a service request, on a ticketing system. In a more formal definition, it should be seen as an operational process, which is a set of correlated activities executed as one unit of work, with its own frequency. The owner of each scenario will be the cloud operations team which has associated OCI Groups and Policies that allow the management of those resources.



The AI Service LZ Extension has three operation scenarios described in the following table.
