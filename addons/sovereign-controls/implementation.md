## Summary
This guide covers implementation of principles outlined in the [Sovereign Controls addon](./readme.md) document. As an example we're going to implement restrictions for a German customer using EU Sovereign Cloud and who wants to restrict data to the `eu-frankfurt-2` region. However, configuration files can be modified to specifically fit the sovereign requiremnts of any customer.

## 1. Groups
If a certain user group needs to be restricted to provisioning resources in a specific region, it's recommended to create a region-specific group. As IAM Groups are global resources, we denote the region specificity using a naming convention, e.g., `grp-${region}-security-admins`. You can see an example configuration in the [identity.auto.tfvars.json](./identity.auto.tfvars.json) file, section `groups_configuration`. These groups can either extend the default groups provided by a landing zone or replace them if only a specific region is required.

> [!WARNING]
> Groups and policies controlling access permisions to IAM need to be always applied in the [Home Region](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingregions.htm#The) otherwise they have no effect.

## 2. Policies
Policies are applied to region specifric groups created in the previous step. All policies in Sovereign Landing Zone addon use the same permissions as in [One-OE](../../blueprints/one-oe) LZ, but with addition of a condition to limit the permission to a specific region e.g.
```
Allow group grp-str-security-admins to manage all-resources in tenancy where request.region = 'str'
```

## 3. Quota Policies
Use Quota Policies in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to control resource creation based on a region within Compartments/Tenancy. Quota Policies limit the number of resources that can be created in a Compartment/Tenancy based on the region. In this example the customer wants to make sure there's no quota available in the regions other than `eu-frankfurt-2` region.
```
zero compute-core quota /*/ in tenancy where request.region != 'eu-frankfurt-2'
zero database quota /*/ in tenancy where request.region != 'eu-frankfurt-2'
zero vcn quota /*/ in tenancy where request.region != 'eu-frankfurt-2'
zero filesystem quota /*/ in tenancy where request.region != 'eu-frankfurt-2'
zero object-storage quota /*/ in tenancy where request.region != 'eu-frankfurt-2'
```

> [!NOTE]
> The provided list of Quota Policies is not exhausitve and includes only the most common services used for storing data. See [Available Quota by Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Quotas/Concepts/resourcequotas_topic-Available_Quotas_by_Service.htm) for a full list.

Additionally for a multi-Tenancy set-up [Governance Rules](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/organization_management_overview.htm#governance_rules) in Organizations service can be used to impose restriction on Child Tenancy

## 4. Security Zones
The One-OE blueprint proposes the strongest security posture using all OCI capabilities, including Security Zones. Security Zones apply a security strategy to OCI cloud compartments and prevent actions that could undermine customersâ€™ security posture. Security Zones policies can be applied to various types of cloud infrastructure (network, compute, storage, databases, etc.) to ensure the security of cloud resources and prevent security misconfigurations. Users determine which policies are appropriate for their needs by defining custom policy sets for each security zone.
In the One-OE blueprint 5 recipes are included following the best practices as example.

Security landing zones are defined using the various OCIDs of the security zone policies. These OCIDs are linked to specific realms. For the sovereign realm, you need to use the appropriate OCID.
Example of recipe:
```
"SZ-RCP-LZP-03-SHARED-NETWORK-KEY": {
                "name": "sz-rcp-lzp-03-shared-network",
                "description": "Recipe 03 Shared Network",
                "compartment_id": "CMP-LZP-SECURITY-KEY",
                "cis_level": "2",
                "security_policies_ocids": [
                    "ocid1.securityzonessecuritypolicy.oc19..aaaaaaaavolswrbfqy6qn2qe7zek2dumml6pbmyzv47q6jfwdatrywmqumba",

                ]
            },
```
